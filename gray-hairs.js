*  Gray hairs (2023)
*  by Terhi Marttila
*
*  Gray hairs is about the gendered practice of dyeing one's hair.
*  A collection of fragments/observations collected in conversation with people.
*  Performed through the voice of Terhi Marttila under a collective "I".
*
*  Project credits and acknowledgments:
*
*  Terhi Marttila: concept, programming, texts, voice
*  Tero Marttila: for code written in 2016 for Give Me a Reason that has been
*  simplified to create the function loadAudios()
*  Diogo Cocharro: for recording equipment (audio interface, microphone, stand)
*  Silvia Freitas and Celeste Pedro: for support, encouragement and testing
*  Amanda Hodes and editorial team: for accepting Gray hairs for publication in
*  the Spring 2023 issue of the New River Journal
*
*  This work is part of Terhi's post doctoral artistic research at IST/ID.
*  This research was funded by the Portuguese Recovery and Resilience Program
*  (PRR), IAPMEI/ANI/FCT under Agenda C645022399-00000057 (eGamesLab).
