  <p><em>Gray hairs</em> is a browser-based literary work for mobile/desktop.
    The screen (or videoprojection) is filled with small black dots which slowly
    begin to fade to white. I click on the graying dots, which reveals a slowly
    unfolding narrative about gray hairs and about dyeing one's hair. </p>

    <p>As the
    words appear on the screen, I read them out loud. I pace my reading depending on
    how I am feeling the text that day, and according to the mood of and
    response from the audience. As such, a live reading of <em>Gray hairs</em>
    takes about 15-20 minutes depending on the situation.</p>

    <p>The live reading/performance finishes with the words "... at the end",
    at which point I place the microphone back on the stand and step away from
    my computar to signal the end of the performance.</p>



  <h2>Description of the stage setup</h2>
  <p>A tall podium (or alternately, a small table and chair) with my laptop
  are placed towards the back of the stage, close to the
  projection surface. I am not illuminated by stage lights, rather, the
  videoprojection of the work obfuscates my form while simultaneously
  illuminating it somewhat (see image below).</p>

  <h2>Technical rider</h2>
  <p><em>Gray hairs</em> is performed with a fullscreen projection that runs
  from my personal laptop (Macbook Pro, with HDMI output). I speak into a
  handheld microphone as I click through the poem. There is no audio output from
  the computer.</p>
